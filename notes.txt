# Should you want to use my roles to play with ansible, you need to run the selfsign crt and key, then copy them over to your roles

Go to the generic webserver box that you just created
	mkdir /etc/ssl/private
	chmod 700 /etc/ssl/private
	openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/webserver1.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/webserver1.crt

Answer all of the questions then you will have the files at those two locations: /etc/ssl/private/ and /etc/ssl/certs/
then copy over to your ansible server/ controller.  If you use mine, then I placed the ssl key and crt files (generic, self-signed in these directories)
	roles/webserver1/files/webserver1.key 
	roles/webserver2/files/webserver2.key 
	roles/webserver1/files/webserver1.crt 
	roles/webserver2/files/webserver2.crt 

Just remember that you should be able to scp from the ansible controller box to your generic webbox - if you could not, then your ansible playbook would not run anyway
